# Manually Installing BTE

Using the official installer for BuildTheEarth no longer works for me, so I've decided to do it manually.

---

## Required Steps
### 1. Install Forge 1.12.2
You can use any 1.12.2 version, though I personally used the [latest one](https://maven.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/1.12.2-14.23.5.2860/forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2860-installer.jar), as it was used by the official BuildTheEarth modpack. Simply run it and press Install.

### 2. Run Minecraft
Open Minecraft Launcher -- Forge 1.12.2 should now be selected. Start the game, and when you reach the main menu, quit it.

### 3. Open your Minecraft folder
Open Minecraft Launcher again and click on the "Installations" tab. Hover over Forge 1.12.2 and click the folder icon.

### 4. Install the mods
[Download](https://github.com/RyanGarber/BuildTheEarth-Manual-Install/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) this zip file. Copy everything from the zip file's `mods` folder to your Minecraft's `mods` folder.

## Optional Steps
### 5. Install OptiFine
If, like me, you prefer more realistic lighting and/or textures, stay tuned for an appendix here.
